# Assingment-2 For Big Data Management and Processing Course COMP-548DL
The data model implementation is on MongoDB Atlas. 
I've created a Read_user in order to access the database (used compass) and allowed the IP address access to be from anywhere. So you can connect via the connection string below.

## Connection
Connection String: "mongodb+srv://Read_user:Assignment@cluster0.rxdbvnd.mongodb.net/"

## Implementations
- I've created 2 collection of documents for Users and Documents.
- They are in JSON format.
- Uploaded 2 example of JSON files.
